## Description

This project is a deep dive into implementing advanced HTML structures based solely on provided mockups. The focus will be on using pure HTML to construct web pages, emphasizing the importance of semantics and accessibility without the aid of CSS or inline styles. This educational journey will cover all HTML tags, their utility, and how to arrange them to faithfully transform a mockup into a functional web page.

#### `General`
By the end of this project, you should be able to [explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/), **without the help of Google:**

<details>
<summary>What is HTML</summary>
<br>

- **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** is the standard markup language used for creating and structuring web pages and applications.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How to create an HTML page from a wireframe</summary>
<br>

- **Creating an HTML page from a wireframe:** Start by analyzing the mockup to identify the different components. Then use HTML tags to reproduce the structure and content, placing elements logically and semantically in your code.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What is a markup language</summary>
<br>

- **A markup language** is a coding system that uses tags to structure text in a document. Besides structuring, it also allows for adding semantics and formatting instructions.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What is the DOM</summary>
<br>

- **The DOM (Document Object Model)** is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the page as a tree structure, allowing for the content, structure, and style to be modified via scripts.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What is an element / tag</summary>
<br>

- **An element or tag** in HTML is a basic unit of webpage structure. Elements are defined by tags, like `<p>` for paragraphs, which can also contain attributes.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What is an attribute</summary>
<br>

- **An attribute** provides additional information about an HTML element, such as the reference URL for links in the `href` attribute of the `<a>` tag.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What is the purpose of each HTML tag</summary>
<br>

- **The purpose of each HTML tag** is to define and structure the web page content for the browser. For instance, `<header>` defines the heading of a section or page, `<footer>` for the footer, `<img>` to embed images, and so on.
